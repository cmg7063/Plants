# Git / Github info

## Clone

When you clone a repo it will create a folder with repo's name One-Plus. It will have a .git file in it which will track any changes to the folder.  
The unity files will be in `One-Plus\One Plus\`. **Leave this as is to prevent adding local settings to the repo.**  

## Branch

You can use Git GUI like source tree to do these features for you.  

**Command line**
*	Create new branch `git checkout -b (branchName)`
*	View local branches and current branch `git branch`
*	Change local branch `git checkout (branchName)`
*	Delete local branch `git branch -d (branchName)`


## Staging, Commiting, and Pushing

You can use Git GUI like source tree to do these features for you.  

**Command line**  
*	Discard Changes `git checkout /file/path/to/revert` or `git checkout .` discard all file changes
*	Check status `git status`
*	Stage changes `git add (file name)` or `git add --a` to add all changed files
*	Commit `git commit -m '(commit message)`
*	Push `git push (remote) (branch)` remote will generally be `origin`

6. When auto merge allowed, merge into master **as squash and merge**
